## Overview

EduQuest is a decentralized application (DApp) built for the **EDU Chain Hackathon: Semester 3**, designed to gamify learning on the EDU Chain blockchain. It incentivizes students to complete educational quests and tests, earning points that are securely stored on-chain using Solidity smart contracts. Users can redeem these points for rewards like badges, while a dynamic leaderboard showcases top learners, fostering a competitive yet engaging environment aligned with EDU Chain's "Learn Own Earn" philosophy.

## Features

- **Profile Dashboard**: View your total points and completed quests in a sleek adventurer-themed card.
- **Dynamic Leaderboard**: Real-time top 3 learners with points and rewards (e.g., Bronze/Silver Badge).
- **Quest System**: Complete learning tasks by submitting points earned from studying or tests.
- **Reward Redemption**: Redeem points for virtual rewards, tracked on the EDU Chain blockchain.
- **Demo Illustration**: Visual guide showing "Study → Test → Earn" flow with a modern UI.
- **Web3 Integration**: Built with Solidity and Web3Dart for seamless blockchain interaction.
